# Theme Persistence Test Verification

## Changes Made

I have successfully updated the dashboard to use the centralized ThemeContext instead of local theme state management. Here are the specific changes:

### 1. **ThemeContext Integration**
- Added import for `useTheme` from `../contexts/ThemeContext`
- Replaced local `isDarkMode` state with theme context
- Replaced local `toggleTheme` function with theme context function

### 2. **Removed Local Theme Management**
- ❌ Removed `useState` for `isDarkMode`  
- ❌ Removed local theme initialization `useEffect`
- ❌ Removed local `toggleTheme` function
- ❌ Removed manual localStorage management
- ❌ Removed manual body class toggling

### 3. **Benefits of the Update**
- ✅ **Theme Persistence**: Theme preference now persists across page refreshes
- ✅ **Centralized Management**: All theme logic is now in one place (ThemeContext)
- ✅ **Automatic Synchronization**: Theme state automatically syncs with localStorage and DOM
- ✅ **Cross-Component Consistency**: Any component using the ThemeContext will stay in sync

## How to Test

1. **Open the dashboard** in your browser
2. **Toggle the theme** using the sun/moon button in the top right
3. **Refresh the page** - the theme should persist
4. **Navigate between pages** - the theme should remain consistent
5. **Close and reopen the browser** - the theme should still be remembered

## Technical Details

The ThemeContext now handles:
- **localStorage synchronization** - Automatically saves theme preference
- **DOM updates** - Applies `data-theme` attribute and `dark-mode` class
- **Cross-component state** - All components using `useTheme` stay synchronized

## File Changes

- ✏️ **`frontend/src/pages/dashboard.js`** - Updated to use ThemeContext
- ✅ **`frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.js`** - Previously created centralized theme management

The theme persistence issue has been resolved. The dashboard will now maintain the selected theme across page refreshes and browser sessions.
